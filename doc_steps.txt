Step-by-Step Setup: React + FastAPI
1. Create a React Project

Create your React project using your preferred method (Vite or Create React App).

2. Create a Virtual Environment (venv)

Run the following command inside your backend project directory:

python -m venv env_name

3. Activate the Virtual Environment

Navigate to the Scripts folder and activate the virtual environment:

env_name\Scripts\Activate.ps1


After activation, the terminal prompt will show the environment name, for example:

(env_name) PS C:\Users\thani\OneDrive\Documents\own_project\practice\fastapi-demo-products-with-ui>

4. Deactivate the Virtual Environment

To deactivate the virtual environment, run:

deactivate

5. Install FastAPI and Uvicorn

While the virtual environment is active, install FastAPI and Uvicorn:

pip install fastapi uvicorn

6. Create the FastAPI Server File

Create a Python file for your FastAPI server (for example, main.py).

Import FastAPI:

from fastapi import FastAPI


Create the FastAPI application object:

app = FastAPI()

7. Create an Endpoint to Return a Web Response

Define an endpoint to handle requests to the root URL (/):

@app.get("/")
def greet():
    return "Welcome"


Here, app refers to the FastAPI application object created earlier.
FastAPI uses this object to register endpoints and handle incoming requests.

Result

When you run the FastAPI server and open the browser at /, the following response will be displayed:

Welcome
